# CryptoChat
NSA-Proof Secure P2P Chat client

NOTES:
  You may have port forwarded the desired chat port
  All communications are encrypted with XOR, AES, and base64
  To chat with someone make sure that they have your ip address and port you are using (get it from ipchicken.com).
  NEVER PUBLICLY POST YOUR IP! This could result in: Getting DDoSed, Doxed, being hacked, having the feds at your door, being killed, etc.
  Also make sure you are using the same keys as the person you are chatting with else it will not work.
  Always transfer the keys securely otherwise someone could eavesdrop on you and decrypt the conversation if they know what they are doing
  
Commands:
  /send <file>:
    sends a file over the chat, saves under random filename (Work in progess)
  /leave
    Closes chat client for both users chatting, ends session.
  More to come soon.
